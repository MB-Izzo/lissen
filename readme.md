# Lissen

A TUI subsonic client in golang made for educational purposes.

* ~~Will use [beep](https://github.com/gopxl/beep) for playing sounds.~~
* It seems that [go-mpv](https://github.com/gen2brain/go-mpv) might be a better idea.
* Might need to rely on [supersonic](https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic) version of [go-mpv](https://github.com/supersonic-app/go-mpv)
* TUI with [go-cui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui)
